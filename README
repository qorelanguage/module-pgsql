pgsql (PostgreSQL) module for Qore
by David Nichols

Requires qore 0.8.6+ (for all possible features) and postgresql headers and libraries to build

This module is released under a choice of two licenses: LGPL 2.1 and MIT; see
COPYING.LGPL and COPYING.MIT for more information

The driver supports the following features:
* all builtin PostgreSQL data types are supported
* multi-dimensional arrays are supported for binding and retrieving
* is thread-safe
* stored procedure execution is supported
* transaction management is supported
* transparent character encoding conversion is supported if necessary
*) the "optimal-numbers" option is set by default as of module version 2.2
*) supports a server timezone setting for correctly handling date/time value
   when communicating with a DB server in another time zone
*) the prepared statement API is support (SQLStatement class)

The driver's name is "pgsql" and the Datasource type constant is SQL::DSPGSQL
ex: $db = new Datasource(DSPGSQL);
ex: $db = new Datasource("pgsql");

The Qore pgsql driver uses binary communication with PostgreSQL servers and sets per-connection variables on server settings (i.e. it automatically determines if the server is using floats or 64-bit integers for time values, etc).
This module is stable and has been extensively tested.

The source code is released under the LGPL 2.1 and MIT licenses; either license
may be used at the user's descretion.  Note that both licenses are treated
equally by the Qore library in the sense that both licenses allow the module
to be loaded without restrictions by the Qore library (even when the Qore
library is initialized in GPL mode).
See COPYING.MIT and COPYING.LGPL for details on the open-source licenses.


BUILD AND INSTALL
-----------------

PostgreSQL DBI module requires PostgreSQL 7+ client libraries and headers
If your PostgreSQL libraries are in a non-standard location you can use the --with-pgsql configure option or set the PGSQL_DIR environment variable.

configure
make
sudo make install

The configure script will find out where your qore module directory is found and set this for the install directory.

BUILD FROM SVN
--------------

reconf.sh
configure
make
sudo make install
