pgsql (PostgreSQL) module for Qore
version 1.0 by David Nichols

Requires qore 0.7.0 and postgresql headers and libraries to build

The driver supports the following features:
* all builtin PostgreSQL data types are supported
* multi-dimensional arrays are supported for binding and retrieving
* is thread-safe
* stored procedure execution is supported
* transaction management is supported
* transparent character encoding conversion is supported if necessary

The driver's name is "pgsql" and the Datasource type constant is SQL::DSPGSQL
ex: $db = new Datasource(DSPGSQL);
ex: $db = new Datasource("pgsql");

The Qore pgsql driver uses binary communication with PostgreSQL servers and sets per-connection variables on server settings (i.e. it automatically determines if the server is using floats or 64-bit integers for time values, etc).
This module is stable and has been extensively tested.

PostgreSQL DBI module requires PostgreSQL 7+ client libraries and headers
If your PostgreSQL libraries are in a non-standard location you can use the --with-pgsql configure option or set the PGSQL_DIR environment variable.

configure
make
sudo make install

The configure script will find out where your qore module directory is found and set this for the install directory.
